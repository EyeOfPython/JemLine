echo nl2br("These Standard Terms and Conditions for Internet Advertising for Media Buys One Year or Less are intended to offer Media Companies, Advertisers, and their Agencies a voluntary standard for conducting business in a manner acceptable to all parties. This document is to accompany Agency or Media Company insertion orders and represents a common understanding for doing business. This document may not fully cover sponsorships and other arrangements involving content association or integration, and/or special production, but may be used as the basis for the media components of such contracts.
INSERTION ORDERS AND INVENTORY AVAILABILITY 
a.
From time to time, parties may negotiate insertion orders
(“IO”s) under which a Media Company will deliver
advertisements provided by Agency (“Ad(s)”) to Media
Company’s site(s) (the “Site”) for the benefit of an Agency or
Advertiser. At Agency’s discretion, an IO may either be
submitted by Agency to Media Company or be submitted by
Media Company, signed by Agency and returned to Media
Company. In either case, an IO will be binding only if
accepted as provided in Section I(b) below. Each IO shall
specify: (a) the type(s) and amount(s) of inventory to be
delivered (e.g., impressions, clicks or other desired actions)
(the “Deliverables”); (b) the price(s) for such Deliverables; (c)
the maximum amount of money to be spent pursuant to the IO
(if applicable), (d) the start and end dates of the campaign,
and (e) the identity of and contact information for any third
party ad server ('3rd Party Ad Server'), if applicable. Other
items that may be included are, but are not limited to:
reporting requirements such as impressions or other
performance criteria; any special Ad delivery scheduling
and/or Ad placement requirements; and specifications
concerning ownership of data collected.
b. Media Company will make commercially reasonable efforts to
notify Agency within two business days of receipt of an IO
signed by Agency if the specified inventory is not available.
Acceptance of the IO and these Terms and Conditions will be
made upon the earlier of (a) written (which, unless otherwise
specified, for purposes of these Terms and Conditions shall
include paper, fax, or e-mail communication) approval of the
IO by Media Company and Agency; or (b) the display of the
first Ad impression by Media Company, unless otherwise
agreed upon in the IO. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
modifications to the originally submitted IO will not be binding
unless signed by both parties.
c.
Revisions to accepted IOs must be made in writing and
acknowledged by the other party in writing.
II. AD PLACEMENT AND POSITIONING
a.
Media Company must comply with the IO, including all Ad
placement restrictions, requirements to create a reasonably
balanced delivery schedule, and provide within the scope of
the IO, an Ad to the Site specified on the IO when such Site is
called up by an Internet user. Any exceptions must be
approved by Agency in writing.
b.
Media Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide Agency at least 10 business days, prior notification of
any material changes to the Site that would change the target
audience or significantly affect the size or placement of the Ad
specified in the affected IO. Should such a modification occur
with or without notice, as Agency’s and Advertiser’s sole
remedy for change or notice, Agency may immediately cancel
the remainder of the IO without penalty within the 10-day
notice period. If Media Company has failed to provide such
notification, Agency may cancel the remainder of the IO within
30 days of such modification, and in such case shall not be
charged for any affected Ads delivered after such
modification.
c. Media Company will submit or otherwise make electronically
accessible to Agency within two business days of acceptance
of an IO final technical specifications, as agreed upon by the
parties. Changes to the specifications of the already-
purchased Ads after that two business day period will allow
Advertiser to suspend (without impacting the end date unless
otherwise agreed by the parties) delivery of the affected Ad
for a reasonable time in order to either (i) send revised
artwork, copy, or active URLs (“Advertising Materials”); (ii)
request that Media Company resize the Ad at Media
Company’s cost, and with final creative approval of Agency,
within a reasonable time period to fulfill the guaranteed levels
of the IO; (iii) accept a comparable replacement; or (iv) if the
parties are unable to negotiate an alternate or comparable
replacement in good faith within 5 business days, immediately
cancel the remainder of the IO for the affected Ad without
penalty.
d. Ad delivery shall comply with editorial adjacencies guidelines
stated on the IO. As Advertiser’s and Agency’s sole remedy
for a violation of the foregoing sentence: (i) Ads that run in
violation of such editorial adjacencies guidelines, if Media
Company is notified of such violation within 30 days of the
violation, shall be non-billable; and (ii) after Agency notifies
Media Company that specific Ads are in violation of such
editorial adjacencies guidelines, Media Company will make
commercially reasonable efforts to correct within 24 hours
such violation. In the event that such correction materially and
adversely impacts such IO, the parties will negotiate in good
faith mutually agreed changes to such IO to address such
impacts. In the event that the parties cannot reach agreement
on such changes within five business days from the
implementation of such correction, Agency or Media
Company may, upon the conclusion of such 5 business day
period, immediately cancel such IO, without penalty.
III. PAYMENT AND PAYMENT LIABILITY
a.
Invoices
The initial invoice will be sent upon completion of the first
month’s delivery or within 30 days of completion of the IO,
whichever is earlier. Invoices are to be sent to: Agency’s
billing address as set forth in the IO and must include
information reasonably specified by Agency such as the IO
number, Advertiser name, brand name or campaign name,
and any number or other identifiable reference stated as
required for invoicing on the IO. All invoices pursuant to the IO
must be received within 180 days of delivery of all
Deliverables. Failure by Media Company to send such invoice
Ver 2.0
2
of 5
or make such request shall be considered a waiver of right to
payment for delivery of Ads for which no invoice was sent.
Media Company should provide invoices accompanied by
proof of performance for the invoiced period, which may
include access to online or electronic reporting as addressed
in this document, subject to the notice and cure provisions of
Section IV. Media Company should invoice Agency for the
services provided on a calendar month basis with the net cost
(i.e., the cost after subtracting Agency commission) based on
actual delivery or based on prorated distribution of delivery
over the term of the IO, as specified in the applicable IO.
b.
Payment Date
Agency will make payment 30 days from receipt of invoice, or
as otherwise stated in a payment schedule set forth in the IO.
Media Company may notify Agency that it has not received
payment in such thirty-day period and whether it intends to
seek payment directly from Advertiser pursuant to Section IIIc,
and may do so 5 business days after providing such notice.
c.
Payment Liability
Unless otherwise set forth by Agency on the IO, Media
Company agrees to hold Agency liable for payments solely to
the extent proceeds have cleared from Advertiser to Agency
for Ads placed in accordance with the IO. For sums not
cleared to Agency, Media Company agrees to hold Advertiser
solely liable. Media Company understands that Advertiser is
Agency’s disclosed principal and Agency, as agent, has no
obligations relating to such payments, either joint or several,
except as specifically set forth in this Section III(c) and
Section X(c).
Agency agrees to make every reasonable effort to collect and
clear payment from Advertiser on a timely basis.
Agency’s credit is established on a client-by-client basis.
If Advertiser proceeds have not cleared for the IO, other
Advertisers from the representing Agency shall not be
prohibited from advertising on the Site due to such non-
clearance if such other Advertisers’ credit is not in question.
Agency will make available to Media Company upon request
written confirmation of the relationship between Agency and
Advertiser. This confirmation should include, for example,
Advertiser’s acknowledgement that Agency is its agent and is
authorized to act on its behalf in connection with the IO and
these Terms and Conditions. In addition, upon the request of
Media Company, Agency will confirm whether Advertiser has
paid to Agency in advance funds sufficient to make payments
pursuant to the IO.
If Advertiser’s or Agency’s credit is or becomes impaired,
Media Company may require payment in advance.
IV. REPORTING
a. Media Company must, within 2 business days of the start date
on the IO, provide confirmation to Agency, either electronically
or in writing, stating whether the components of the IO have
begun delivery.
b.
Media Company shall make reporting available at least as
often as weekly, either electronically or in writing, unless
otherwise specified in the IO. Reports must be broken out by
day and summarized by creative execution, content area (Ad
placement), and other variables defined in the IO, for
example, impressions, keywords, and/or clicks.
Once Media Company has provided the online or electronic
report, it agrees that Agency and Advertiser are entitled to
reasonably rely on it, subject to receipt of Media Company’s
invoice for such period.
c. In the event that Media Company fails to deliver an accurate
and complete report by the time specified, Agency may initiate
makegood discussions pursuant to Section VI below.
In the event that Media Company learns that it has delivered
an incomplete or inaccurate report, or no report at all, Media
Company must cure such failure within 5 business days.
Failure to cure may result in nonpayment for all activity for
which data are incomplete or missing, until Media Company
delivers reasonable evidence of performance and such report
must be delivered within 30 days of Media Company’s
learning of such failure or absent such knowledge, within 180
days of delivery of all Deliverables.
V. CANCELLATION AND TERMINATION
a. At any time prior to the serving of the first impression of the
IO, Agency may cancel the IO with 30 days prior written
notice, without penalty. For clarity and by way of example, if
Agency cancels the IO 15 days prior to the serving of the first
impression, Advertiser will only be responsible for the first 15
days of the IO.
b. Upon the serving of the first impression of the IO, Agency may
cancel the IO for any reason, without penalty, by providing
Media Company written notice of cancellation which will be
effective after the later of: (i) 30 days after serving the first
impression of the IO; or (ii) 14 days after providing Media
Company with such written notice.
c. Either party may terminate an IO at any time if the other party
is in material breach of its obligations hereunder that is not
cured within 10 days after written notice thereof from the
nonbreaching party, except as otherwise stated in this
Agreement with regard to specific breaches. Additionally, if
Agency or Advertiser commit a violation of the same Policy
(as defined below), where such Policy had been provided by
Media Company to Agency, on three separate occasions after
having received timely notice of each such breach, even if
such breach has been cured by Agency or Advertiser, then
Media Company may terminate the IO associated with such
breach upon written notice. If Agency or Advertiser do not
cure a violation of a Policy within the applicable ten day cure
period after written notice, where such Policy had been
provided by Media Company to Agency, then Media Company
may terminate the IO associated with such breach upon
written notice.
d. Short rates will apply to cancelled buys to the degree stated
on the IO.
VI. MAKEGOODS
a. Media Company shall monitor delivery of the Ads, and shall
notify Agency either electronically or in writing as soon as
possible (and no later than two weeks before IO end date
unless the length of the campaign is less than two weeks) if
Media Company believes that an under-delivery is likely. In
the case of a probable or actual under-delivery, the parties
may arrange for makegood consistent with these Terms and
Conditions.
b.
In the event that actual Deliverables for any campaign fall
below guaranteed levels, as set forth in the IO, and/or if there
is an omission of any Ad (placement or creative unit), Agency
and Media Company will make an effort to agree upon the
conditions of a makegood flight either in the IO or at the time
Ver 2.0
3
of 5
of the shortfall. If no makegood can be agreed upon, Agency
may execute a credit equal to the value of the under-delivered
portion of the contract IO for which it was charged. In the
event that Agency or Advertiser has made a cash pre-
payment to Media Company, specifically for the campaign IO
for which under-delivery applies, then if Agency and/or
Advertiser is reasonably current on all amounts owed to
Media Company under any other agreement for such
Advertiser, Agency may elect to receive a refund for the
under-delivery equal to the difference between the applicable
pre-payment and the value of the delivered portion of the
campaign. In no event shall Media Company provide a
makegood or extend any Ad beyond the period set forth in the
IO without prior written consent of Agency.
V
II. BONUS IMPRESSIONS
a.
Where Agency utilizes a 3rd Party Ad Server, Media
Company will not bonus more than 10% above the
Deliverables specified in the IO without prior written consent
from Agency. Permanent or exclusive placements shall run for
the specified period of time regardless of over-delivery, unless
the IO establishes an impression cap for Third Party Ad
served activity. Agency will not be charged by Media
Company for any additional Ads above any level guaranteed
or capped in the IO. If a 3rd Party Ad Server is being used
and Agency notifies Media Company that the guaranteed or
capped levels stated in the IO have been reached, Media
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to suspend
delivery and, within 48 hours, may either 1) serve any
additional Ads itself or 2) be held responsible for all applicable
incremental Ad serving charges incurred by Advertiser after
such notice has been provided and associated with
overdelivery by more than 10% above such guaranteed or
capped levels.
b. Where Agency does not utilize a 3rd Party Ad Server, Media
Company may bonus as many ad units as Media Company
chooses unless otherwise indicated on the IO. Agency will
not be charged by Media Company for any additional
advertising units above any level guaranteed in the IO.
V
III. FORCE MAJEURE
a. Excluding payment obligations, neither party will be liable for
delay or default in the performance of its obligations under
this Agreement if such delay or default is caused by
conditions beyond its reasonable control, including but not
limited to, fire, flood, accident, earthquakes,
telecommunications line failures, electrical outages, network
failures, acts of God, or labor disputes. In the event that
Media Company suffers such a delay or default, Media
Company shall make reasonable efforts within five business
days to recommend a substitute transmission for the Ad or
time period for the transmission. If no such substitute time
period or makegood is reasonably acceptable to Agency,
Media Company shall allow Agency a pro rata reduction in the
space, time and/or program charges hereunder in the amount
of money assigned to the space, time and/or program charges
at time of purchase. In addition, Agency shall have the
benefit of the same discounts that would have been earned
had there been no default or delay.
b. If Agency's ability to transfer funds to third parties has been
materially negatively impacted by an event beyond the
Agency's reasonable control, including, but not limited to,
failure of banking clearing systems or a state of emergency,
then Agency shall make every reasonable effort to make
payments on a timely basis to Media Company, but any
delays caused by such condition shall be excused for the
duration of such condition. Subject to the foregoing, such
excuse for delay shall not in any way relieve Agency from any
of its obligations as to the amount of money that would have
been due and paid without such condition.
c.
To the extent that a force majeure has continued for 5
business days, Media Company or Agency has the right to
cancel the remainder of the IO without penalty.
IX. AD MATERIALS
a.
It is Agency’s obligation to submit Advertising Materials in
accordance with Media Company’s then existing advertising
criteria or specifications (including content limitations,
technical specifications, privacy policies, user experience
policies, policies regarding consistency with Media
Company’s public image, community standards regarding
obscenity or indecency (taking into consideration the
portion(s) of the Site on which the Ads are to appear), other
editorial or advertising policies, and material due dates)
(collectively 'Policies') in accordance with Section II(c).
Media Company's sole remedy for a breach of this provision is
set forth in paragraphs (b and c) below, Section V(c), and
Section X(b). If Advertising Materials are late, Advertiser is
still responsible for the media purchased pursuant to IO.
b.
Media Company reserves the right within its discretion to
reject or remove from its Site any Ads where the Advertising
Materials or the site to which the Ad is linked do not comply
with its Policies, or that in Media Company’s sole reasonable
judgment, do not comply with any applicable law, regulation or
other judicial or administrative order. In addition, Media
Company reserves the right within its discretion to reject or
remove from its Site any Ads where the Advertising Materials
or the site to which the Ad is linked are or may tend to bring
disparagement, ridicule, or scorn upon Media Company or
any of its Affiliates (as defined below), provided that if Media
Company has reviewed and approved such Ads prior to their
use on the Site, Media Company will not immediately remove
such Ads before making commercially reasonable efforts to
acquire mutually acceptable alternative Advertising Materials
from Agency
.
c. If Advertising Materials provided by Agency are damaged, not
to Media Company’s specifications, or otherwise
unacceptable, Media Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to notify Agency within two business days
of its receipt of such Advertising Materials.
d. Media Company will not edit or modify the submitted Ads in
any way, including, but without limitation, resizing the Ad,
without Agency approval. Media Company shall use all such
Ads in strict compliance with these Terms and Conditions and
any written instructions provided by Agency.
e.
When applicable, Third Party Ad Server tags shall be
implemented so that they are functional in all aspects.
f. Media Company, on one hand, and Agency and Advertiser,
on the other, will not use the other’s trade name, trademarks,
logos or Ads in a public announcement (including, but not
limited to, through any press release) regarding the existence
or content of these Terms and Conditions or an IO without the
other’s prior written approval.
X. INDEMNIFICATION
a.
Media Company agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Agency and Advertiser, their Affiliates (as defined
below) and their respective directors, officers, employees and
agents from any and all damages, liabilities, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (collectively
“Losses”) incurred as a result of a Third Party (as defined
below) claim, judgment or proceeding relating to or arising out
Ver 2.0
4
of 5
of Media Company’s breach of Section XII, Media Company’s
display or delivery of any Ad in breach of these Terms and
Conditions or the terms of an IO, or that materials provided by
Media Company (and not by Agency or Advertiser) for an Ad
violate the right of a Third Party, are defamatory or obscene,
or violate any law, regulations or other judicial or
administrative action, except to the extent (1) that such claim,
judgment or proceeding resulted from such materials fulfilling
Agency's or Advertiser's unique specifications provided that
Media Company did not know or should not have reasonably
known that such specifications would give rise to the Loss or
(2) that such materials are provided to Agency or Advertiser
for review and the Agency or Advertiser knew or should have
reasonably known from the visual or sonic expression of the
Advertisement, while Media Company did not know or should
not have reasonably known, that such material violated any
law, regulations or other judicial or administrative action,
violate the right of a Third Party or are defamatory or
obscene. An Affiliate means, with respect to either party, any
corporation, firm, partnership, person or other entity, whether
de jure or de facto, which directly or indirectly owns, is owned
by or is under common ownership with such party to the
extent of at least 50% of the equity having the power to vote
on or direct the affairs of the entity, and any person, firm,
partnership, corporation or other entity actually controlled by,
controlling or under common control with such party. A 'Third
Party' means an entity other than the parties to this
Agreement, their respective Affiliates, and each of their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents.
b.
Advertiser agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Media Company its Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents from any and all Losses
incurred as a result of a Third Party claim, judgment or
proceeding relating to or arising out of Advertiser’s breach of
Section XII, violation of Policies (to the extent the applicable
terms of such Policies have been provided to Agency at least
ten days prior to the violation giving rise to the claim), or the
content or subject matter of any Ad or Advertising Materials to
the extent used by Media Company in accordance with these
Terms and Conditions or an IO, including but not limited
allegations that such content or subject matter violate the right
of a Third Party, are defamatory or obscene, or violate any
law, regulations or other judicial or administrative action.
c. Agency represents and warrants that it has the authority as
agent to Advertiser to bind Advertiser to these Terms and
Conditions and each IO. Agency agrees to defend, indemnify
and hold harmless Media Company its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents from any
and all Losses incurred as a result of Agency’s alleged breach
of the foregoing sentence.
d.
If any action will be brought against either party (the
“Indemnified Party”) in respect to any allegation for which
indemnity may be sought from the other party (“Indemnifying
Party”), the Indemnified Party will promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party of any such claim of which it becomes
aware and will: (i) provide reasonable cooperation to the
Indemnifying Party at the Indemnifying Party's expense in
connection with the defense or settlement of any such claim;
and (ii) be entitled to participate at its own expense in the
defense of any such claim. The Indemnified Party agrees that
the Indemnifying Party will have sole and exclusive control
over the defense and settlement of any such third party claim.
However, the Indemnifying Party will not acquiesce to any
judgment or enter into any settlement that adversely affects
the Indemnified Party's rights or interests without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party.
e.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
Indemnifying Party is required to defend, indemnify or hold
harmless an Indemnified Party from a claim, judgment or
proceeding of a Related Party (as defined below) of such
Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section X, Losses incurred
in connection with such claim, judgment or proceeding will be
limited to those that are reasonably foreseeable. A 'Related
Party' is a party in a contractual relationship with the
Indemnified Party where such specific contractual relationship
relates to the Loss being asserted by that Related Party.
XI. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Excluding the parties obligations under Section X or damages that
result from a breach of Section XII or intentional misconduct by the
parties, in no event will either party be liable for any consequential,
indirect, incidental, punitive, special or exemplary damages
whatsoever, including without limitation, damages for loss of
profits, business interruption, loss of information and the like,
incurred by the other party arising out of this Agreement, even if
such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
XII. NON-DISCLOSURE, DATA OWNERSHIP, PRIVACY AND LAWS
a.
Any marked confidential information and proprietary data
provided by one party, including the Ad description, and the
pricing of the Ad, set forth in the IO, shall be deemed
“Confidential Information” of the disclosing party. Confidential
Information shall also include information provided by one
party, which under the circumstances surrounding the
disclosure would be reasonably deemed confidential or
proprietary. Confidential Information shall not be released by
the receiving party to anyone except an employee, or agent
who has a need to know same, and who is bound by
confidentiality obligations. Neither party will use any portion of
Confidential Information provided by the other party
hereunder for any purpose other than those provided for
under this Agreement.
b. For purposes of this Section, Agency and Advertiser shall be
considered one party. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the term “Confidential Information” shall
not include information which: (i) was previously known to a
party; (ii) was or becomes generally available to the public
through no fault of the receiving party (“Recipient”); (iii) was
rightfully in Recipient’s possession free of any obligation of
confidence at, or subsequent to, the time it was
communicated to Recipient by the disclosing party
(“Discloser”); (iv) was developed by employees or agents of
Recipient independently of and without reference to any
information communicated to Recipient by Discloser; or (v)
was communicated by Discloser to an unaffiliated third party
free of any obligation of confidence. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either party may disclose Confidential Information
in response to a valid order by a court or other governmental
body, as otherwise required by law or the rules of any
applicable securities exchange or as necessary to establish
the rights of either party under this Agreement; provided,
however, that both parties will stipulate to any orders
necessary to protect said information from public disclosure.
c.
All personally identifiable information provided by individual
web users who are informed that such information is being
gathered solely on behalf of Advertiser pursuant to the
Advertiser’s posted privacy policy is the property of
Advertiser, is subject to the Advertiser's posted privacy policy,
and is considered Confidential Information. Any other use of
such information must be set forth in the IO signed by both
parties.
d. Media Company, Agency, and Advertiser shall post on their
respective Web sites their privacy policies and adhere to their
privacy policies, which abide by the applicable laws. Failure
by Media Company, on one hand, or Agency or Advertiser, on
Ver 2.0
5
of 5
the other, to continue to post a privacy policy or non-
adherence to its own privacy policy is grounds for immediate
cancellation of the IO by the other parties.
e. Agency, Advertiser and Media Company will comply with at all
times, all applicable federal, state and local law, ordinances,
regulations and codes which are relevant to their performance
of their respective obligations under this Agreement.
X
III. THIRD PARTY AD SERVERS
(Applicable if 3
rd
Party Server Is Used)
a.
a.
Media Company will track delivery through its ad server
and Agency will also track delivery through its proprietary or
subcontracted 3rd Party Ad Server whose identity is set forth
in the IO. Agency may not substitute the 3
rd
Party Ad Server
specified in the IO without Media Company's consent.
Agency and Media Company agree to give reciprocal access
to relevant and non-proprietary statistics from both ad servers,
or if such is not available, provide weekly placement-level
activity reports to each other. In the event that the Media
Company’s ad server measurements are higher than those
produced by the Agency’s 3
rd
Party Ad Server by more than
10% over the invoice period, Agency will facilitate a
reconciliation effort between Media Company and 3
rd
Party Ad
Server. If the discrepancy cannot be resolved and Agency has
made a good faith effort to facilitate the reconciliation effort,
the Agency reserves the right to either:
1.
Consider the discrepancy an under-delivery of the
Deliverables as described in Section VI(b) whereupon
the parties shall act in accordance with that Section,
including the requirement that Agency and Media
Company make an effort to agree upon the conditions of
a makegood flight, except that for purposes of this
Section XIII(a)(1), delivery of any makegood shall be
measured by the 3
rd
Party Ad Server, or
2.
Pay Media Company based on Agency 3
rd
party Ad
Server reported data, plus a 10% upward adjustment to
delivery.
b. Media Company will make reasonable efforts to publish, and
Agency shall make reasonable efforts to cause the 3
rd
Party
Ad Server to publish, a disclosure in the form specified by the
AAAA and IAB regarding their respective ad delivery
measurement methodologies with regards to compliance with
the IAB/AAAA Ad Measurement Guidelines.
c. Section XIII(a) shall be terminated upon the establishment of
an IAB/AAAA certification process for compliance with the
IAB/AAAA Ad Measurement Guidelines. Upon such
termination the parties shall negotiate in good faith a
replacement or successor language for that Section.
d. Where an Agency is utilizing a 3
rd
Party Ad Server and that 3
rd
Party Ad Server cannot serve the Ad, the Agency shall have a
one-time right to temporarily suspend delivery under the IO for
a period of up to 72-hours. Upon written notification by
Agency of a non-functioning 3
rd
Party Ad Server, the Media
Company has 24 hours to suspend delivery. Following that
period, Agency will not be held liable for payment for any Ad
that runs within the immediate 72-hour period thereafter until
the Media Company is notified that the 3
rd
Party Ad Server is
able to serve Ads. After the 72-hour period passes and
Agency has not provided written notification that Media
Company can resume delivery under the IO, Advertiser will
pay for the Ads that would have run or are run after the 72
hour period but for the suspension and can elect Media
Company to serve Ads until 3
rd
Party Ad Server is able to
serve Ads. If Agency does not so elect for Media Company to
serve the Ads until 3
rd
Party Ad Server is able to serve Ads,
Media Company may utilize the inventory that would have
been otherwise used for Media Company's own
advertisements or advertisements provided by a third party
Upon notification that the 3
rd
Party Ad Server is functioning,
Media Company will have 72 hours to resume delivery. Any
delay in the resumption of delivery beyond this period, without
reasonable explanation, will result in Media Company owing a
makegood to Agency.
XIV. MISCELLANEOUS
a.
Media Company represents and warrants that Media
Company has all necessary permits, licenses, and clearances
to sell the inventory represented in the IO subject to the terms
and conditions of this agreement, including any applicable
Policies. Advertiser represents and warrants that Advertiser
has all necessary licenses and clearances to use the content
contained in their Ads and Advertising Materials.
b. Neither Agency nor Advertiser may resell, assign or transfer
any of its rights or obligations hereunder, and any attempt to
resell, assign or transfer such rights or obligations without
Media Company’s prior written approval will be null and void.
All terms and provisions of these Terms and Conditions and
each IO will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective permitted transferees,
successors and assigns.
c. These Terms and Conditions and the related IO constitute the
entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject
matter and supersede all previous communications,

matter of the IO. The IO may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be an original and all of which together
shall constitute one and the same document.
d. In the event of any inconsistency between the terms of an IO
and these Terms and Conditions, the terms of the IO shall
prevail. All IOs shall be governed by the laws of the State of
[
]. Media Company and Agency (on behalf of
itself and not Advertiser) agree that any claims, legal
proceeding or litigation arising in connection with the IO
(including these Terms and Conditions) will be brought solely
in [ ], and the parties
consent to the jurisdiction of such courts. No modification of
these Terms and Conditions or any IO shall be binding unless
in writing and signed by both parties. If any provision herein
is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
remain in full force and effect. All rights and remedies
hereunder are cumulative.
e.
Any notice required to be dlivered hereunder shall be
delivered three days after deposit in U.S. mail, return receipt
requested, one business day if sent by overnight courier
service, and immediately if sent electronically or by fax. All
notices to Media Company and Agency shall be sent to the
contact as noted in the IO with a copy to the Legal
Department. All notices to Advertiser shall be sent to the
address specified on the IO.
f. Sections III, VI, X, XI, XII, and XIV shall survive termination or
expiration of this Agreement and Section IV shall survive fore
30 days after the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
In addition, each party shall return or destroy the other party’s
Confidential Information and remove Advertising Materials
and Ad tags.");
